ChatHood

ChatHood is a web application, which allows you to chat and interact with your favourite celebrities.
You can choose any celebrity you admire and have a conversation with them.ðŸ“±
It is a social web app that can be further extended as a mobile application, which allows users to chat with their favorite characters/celebrities. Our Machine Learning model will formulate replies on the basis of what the user asks. This prototype can be further extended so that the replies are based on the actual personalities of those characters.
This app can be used for the people who sometimes need to get out of the real world and dive in into their own little imagination. This app can also be used to help people talk to the personalities that they look up to. 
Other than this it will also be a really fun and entertaining app for the audience of every age group and what better than taking advice from Gandhi himself.

We used RASA in python to use ML through it,
defined intents and utters on our own so no material has been copid off the net,
the main purpose of this code is to talk to celebs or other famous personalities you would not be able to do in normal life.
